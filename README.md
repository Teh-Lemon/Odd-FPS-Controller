# Odd-FPS-Controller

A Valve-like FPS Controller for Unity, (built on-top of the CharacterController component).  
It not only re-creates the familiar feeling of the old Valve/Quake games (e.g. Counter-Strike) but also their quirks such as bunny-hopping and air-strafing.

## Warning!

This Github is for reference only!  

This has been ripped out of an old project. This code hasn't been run in years. I don't know if it will work if you just blindly import it into your project, nor do I remember how to set it up, or if it's even compatible with the latest Unity releases.  

All the important logic you need is in [OddMovement.cs](Scripts/OddMovement.cs).  
Everything else is specific to my project but I included them anyway just in case.
