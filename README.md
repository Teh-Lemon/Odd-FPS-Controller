# Odd-FPS-Controller

A Valve-like FPS Controller for Unity that not only re-creates the familiar feeling of the old Valve/Quake games (like Counter-Strike) but also their quirks such as bunny-hopping and air-strafing.

## Warning!

This Github is for reference only!  

I'm re-uploading this from an old group project that never panned out. This code hasn't been run in years. I don't know if it will work if you just blindly import it into your project nor do I remember how to set it up or if it's even compatible with the latest Unity releases.

All the important logic you need is in [OddMovement.cs](Scripts/OddMovement.cs).  
Everything else was more specific to our project but I included them anyway just in case.
